# 🌸 Sewa | My Cute Money Tracker

Sewa is a minimalist and aesthetic personal finance tracker designed especially for students. It helps you keep track of daily expenses (yes, even that extra Masala Chai or Boba 🧋) without the overwhelming clutter of traditional finance apps.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

Most expense trackers feel overly complex or too “corporate.”  
Sewa focuses on simplicity, friendliness, and visual clarity so users actually *enjoy* tracking their spending.

It answers the age-old student question:

> **“Where did my pocket money go?”**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Existing expense trackers are packed with unnecessary features  
- Interfaces often feel intimidating or boring  
- Students need something quick, simple, and visually engaging  

**Sewa** solves this by offering a cute, clean, and persistent way to log expenses on the go.

## 🧠 DOM Concepts Used

This project heavily relies on core JavaScript and DOM manipulation as per **Batch 2029 Web Dev II guidelines**:

- `document.getElementById()` & query selectors  
- Dynamic element creation using `document.createElement('li')`  
- Event handling with `addEventListener()`  
- `window.onload` for fetching saved data  
- Template literals for dynamic HTML generation  
- DOM-based styling for validation and empty states

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files  
2. Make sure these files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. Start tracking your money 💸✨

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Supports only **Indian Rupees (₹)**
